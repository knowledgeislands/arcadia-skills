/**
 * Eval scenarios for the `ki-authoring` skill.
 *
 * Each scenario probes a *house-specific* convention the skill owns — chosen so a
 * skill-less baseline (which still sees the user's ambient CLAUDE.md) cannot
 * already answer it. The global CLAUDE.md states the headline "wide table →
 * footnote" rule, so we deliberately do NOT test that; we test the rules it says
 * "live in the skill": the footnote-marker SERIES, the wikilink prohibition +
 * angle-bracket form, TOML presentation, and knowledge-promotion routing.
 *
 * Assertions are regexes over the answer text — the deterministic half of the
 * hybrid score. The `rubric` is handed to the LLM judge for the qualitative half.
